## Description

This is the opinionated Rails configuration that I use to develop full-stack Rails + React applications. As a freelance Rails developer, I need to be able to start new projects quickly that are ready for _Test-Driven Development_. I've assembled this template over the years to include best-practices, tweaks, documentation, and personal preferences, while still generally adhering to the "Rails way".

## Requirements

`bin/setup` will install all the necessary packs and gems. Your system will need the following:

* PostgreSQL
* chromedriver

## Installation
