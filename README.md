## Getting Started

## Requirements

* PostgreSQL *or* Docker (depending which method you choose)

### Method #1: Running Rails on your machine

1. Clone this repo to your local machine:

```shell script
git clone https://github.com/patrickclery/amazon-asin.git
```

2. From the command-line, cd into the directory: 

```shell script
cd amazon-asin
```

 If you are using `rvm_autoupdate_flag=1` in your `~/.rvmrc`, this will automatically install Ruby 2.6.5. Otherwise, run it manually:
 
```shell script
 rvm install
```

_Note: Using RVM is optional, just make sure you have Ruby 2.6.5 available._ 

3. Run the setup script. This does several things:
- Installs bundler (if necessary)
- Installs the required ruby gems
- Prepares your database
- Seeds your database

```shell script
bin/setup
```

### Method #2: Docker

1. Fire up Docker on your local machine
2. Run this command to build and deploy the app:

```shell script
docker-compose --env-file=config/docker/.env up
```

_Note: config/docker/.env is generated by `bin/setup` but you can create one using the sample config/docker/.env.sample_

3. Be sure that your Docker container publishes port 3000 (manually required).

### Finally...

Open the app in your browser by navigating to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)

Enjoy :)
